<button type="button" class="collapsible">v0.4.6 - Actions (and some other things too) [testing release: 01/04/2025] </button>
<div class="content"><pre>
v0.4.6
    - implemented new feature, location actions. Unlike trainings, they are generally a one-time thing that provides unlocks and other rewards.
        They can take different time to complete; have different conditions that are not fully specified but will be hinted at by descriptions; 
        might check if conditions are met either before or after the attempt and may either be guaranteed to succeed if so or just have a chance for it,
        with the latter case having different messages for when you failed due to not meeting requirements vs when you were just unlucky and could succeed next time
    
    - made it possible to craft multiple items/components/equips at once (x5/x10/all)
    - added a mechanic of bonus skill levels (e.g. from better tools); these only apply to the basic effects and do not affect milestones
    - implemented personal storage, available at any place with bed, with shared content
    - added fast travel button, allowing quick moving between locations with unlocked beds and/or last combat location (move here from the normal travel category)

    - added multiple new locations and combat areas: <span class="spoiler">
    * bandit hideout in slums
    * two locations (one normal, one combat) after opening the 'mysterious gate' (The Rat Saga continues)
    * multiple mountain locations (one boss, one combat, a few normal + a camp) after climbing up (unlocked by beating one of cave locations)</span>
    - added better tools for gathering materials
    - added a new crafting material, coal, which is now used in all smelting recipes
        It's own recipe is named "charcoal", don't be confused
        It is crafted with any "raw" wood, using cheapest first. 
        Multicrafting will only use one material type on each click, to avoid accidentally burning higher tiers (ha, got it?)
    - added new metal of tier 3, steel, which requires iron + a new ore to craft; added corresponding weapon components; steel unlocked by:<span class="spoiler">
        Reaching level 15 in Forging skill; needed ore unlocked by beating 'mysterious gate'</span>
    - added ash wood and ash wood components, added weak monster bone components; both are tier 3
    - new activity: climbing
    - new skills: Climbing, Breathing, Medicine. Breathing gains xp passively at a low rate (which increases x5 when in any training)
    - two new books, both unlock "new" recipes (lots of them already existed and simply got locked behind this) + one of them unlocks Medicine skill
    - slightly buffed 'weak healing powder' and 'weak healing potion', added stronger versions of both
    - added some other new ingredients and consumables
    - added miscellaneous items 'coil of rope' and 'camping supplies', each is currently only used for a singular action
    - new spot for meditation + another milestone for the skill
    - skills for gathering materials now belong to a separate skill category (instead of 'Activity skills')
    - 'high quality wolf fang' and 'high quality boar tusk' can now be crafted from 50 normal versions each
    - location navigation now uses similar structure as skill display, that is they are grouped together and expand on click
    - made it possible for xp multipliers to affect entire skill categories (e.g. all 'Activity' skills)
    - item rarity rank is now directly displayed in tooltip (before that you had to guess from the color/quality)
    - tooltips for relevant crafting skills now show quality caps
    - activities (job, training, resource gathering) now display the time needed to level up their related skill 
        (with in-game time format, e.g. 24 hours mean 24 irl minutes at standard tickrate)
    - slightly expanded some skill milestones
    - added a Ko-fi icon with link to my page on the right side of the bottom bar

    - equipment qualities are now rounded to nearest even value to reduce inventory cluttering (similarly to how components already had it rounded to nearest multiple of 4) 
    - made attack speed penalties from shields harsher; they are now also present on light shields (but much weaker than on heavy shields)
    - reduced value of crafting components to ~80%, but increased full equipment prices to ~125% (components are cheaper, but equipment prices stay mostly the same)
    - crafting recipes now show their xp values in tooltips
    - reduced the crafting quality cap to 100 + 2.8 * skill_lvl for equips and 100 + 2 * skill_lvl for components
    - buffed success rates of first 2 woodcutting and mining spots
    - buffed success rates of some recipes
    - updated some xp displays to show both the percentage and the raw numbers
    - bottom panel remains visible on loading screen, to allow importing savefile if something breaks and it gets stuck
    - buffed starting health/stamina from 40 to 50
    - slightly nerfed 'starving wolf rats' and 'wolf rats'
    - slightly nerfed 'starving wolfs' and 'wolves'
    - reduced hero level xp cost scaling from 1.8 to 1.7 (this is a buff)
    - location with boars is now not unlocked directly through dialogue, it instead unlocks an action in the "forest road" to search for the area with them
        If you already went through that dialogue, you will just keep the area unlocked and the action should never appear
    - increased reward for dealing with boars to 4 S

    - slightly rewrote the code for location type penalties, allowing for flat effects (e.g. static hp loss every tick)
    - rewrote combat location N-th clear rewards to a form that allows any reward to have such restriction instead of just location unlocks
    - implemented partial reputation system, doesn't really do anything yet and is not currently displayed anywhere (will be expanded in future)
    - slightly changed display settings of the bottom bar

    - fixed a bug where some activities were stopped on reload with a warning in console, due to mismatch in keys
    - fixed a bug in crafting, where some equipments would end up with a different component than was chosen
    - fixed a bug with market saturation not working properly (item sold count wasn't being updated, leading to situation where item price reduction only applied in bulk trading)
    - fixed a bug where additional stats on componentless equipment (clothing) didn't scale with rarity
    - fixed a bug in crafting equipment, where component quality was ignored in tooltips
    - fixed a bug where if skill changed name on levelup, the level increase message would use the new one 
        (it was "skill Y leveled up, skill X was upgraded to Y", instead of "skill X leveled up, skill X was upgraded to Y")
    - fixed a bug with display of unlocked skill milestones, where descriptions sometimes included ", ,"
    - fixed a bug where clicking dropdown icons on skill categories wouldn't expand the content
    - fixed issues with compatibility for saves from some older versions

    - reduced minimum dmg getting through armor from 10% to 5%
v0.4.6.13
    - slightly changed hit/dodge formula to allow an actual 0% chance of being hit; due to this, changed modifiers from enemy group count and enemy size (via skill) to be applied to AP/EP instead (since multiplying 0 by them would be meaningless), which might change how much impact they have
    - fixed a bug on equipping better tools if the related skill was not unlocked

    - fixed a serious error on loading if trying to award some past missed location unlocks
v0.4.6.19
