<button type="button" class="collapsible">v0.5.0 - Quests, Weather, and trade expansion </button>
<div class="content"><pre>
v0.5.0
    - implemented a Quest system
    - implemented a simple weather system (temperature and rain), effects are mostly some penalties of varying degree if you get too cold; clothing now provides cold protection
    - added a small reward (xp-increasing active effect) for exporting the game; when it's available, the export button will be visually marked by bold text and changing colors
    - travelling now moves the in-game timer forward, affecting durations of all active effects except the one from export reward; travel times scale with skills (mostly 'running')
    - added foreground animations for rain and for snow, and a background animation of stars for clear sky night; they are disabled by default and can be enabled in the options panel
    - market saturation system now covers everything except consumables; it has a harsher scaling for equipment and components
    - market saturation has been split into regions (currently: Village and Slums), with saturation slowly trickling between all regions until it balances out; for existing saves, saturations were equally split between the regions
    - added new equipment category, capes; they are rather expensive in terms of material cost, but provide the most cold protection out of all item types and allow you to feel fancy
    - added a new combat zone available from <span class="spoiler">'Forest road'</span>
    - added another stance, available from <span class="spoiler">'Suspicious man' after helping out in the 'Slums' (it technically existed before, but was impossible to unlock);
        as usual with new unlocks, if you already used the textline that's supposed to unlock it then you can get it from the repeatable one instead</span>
    - added a new skill <span class="spoiler">'Regeneration' which increases effectiveness of passive healing (sleeping/resting)</span>
    - added a new skill <span class="spoiler">'Gluttony'  to complement 'medicine' by increasing the effects of the food items (unlike medicine, this one doesn't get xp from crafting)</span>
    - added a new skill and training: <span class="spoiler">'Swimming'</span>, available at <span class="spoiler">'Village', after talking to 'Villag Elder' (unlocked by same eraly textline as running/weightlifting trainings; otherwise just ask him about leaving)</span>
    - added a new skill <span class="spoiler">'Fortitude' which increases max health and gains xp when you take damage, similarly to 'Tough Skin', however it scales with damage taken and not with enemy xp value</span>
    - added a new skill and related items: <span class="spoiler">"Digging" and 2 shovels, used for gathering sand (see: glassmaking, at the bottom of this version's changelog)</span>
    - added a new skill <span class="spoiler">'Cold resistance' which increases cold tolerance by 0.5 per level and gains xp passively at low rate when character is in cold environment</span>
    - renamed 'Crafting' to 'Tinkering', added a new parent skill: <span class="spoiler">"Crafting mastery" which encompasses 'Tinkering', 'Butchering', and 'Woodworking' (for more on the latter 2, see: bottom of this version's changelog)</span>
    - added a new spot for training 'Equilibrium' at <span class="spoiler">'Mountain path' and 'Mountain camp'</span>
    - added a new spot for training 'Climbing' at <span class="spoiler">'Mountain camp'</span>
    - added another book <span class="spoiler">'Ode to Whimsy, and other poems', available at any trader but with a low chance to appear</span>
    - added a new consumable <span class="spoiler">'Bread kwas', made from 2 pieces of any bread and a glass bottle (made from 3 pieces of glass), which gives additional stamina regeneration; while not higher than on bread, it's a different effect meaning it can stack</span>
    - added reputation to display in 'Data' tab (it still does nothing)

    - 'Persistence' skill's xp gains are now doubled when under 20% hp (you still need to be out of stamina); they are also increased when under any cold effect, the stronger the more, up to x2 at 'Hypothermia'
    - 'Unarmed' skill now provides additional +0.1 base dmg to unarmed attacks (original base was 1, this means by lvl 10 dmg will be doubled)
    - 'Tough skin' skill is now back to only receiving xp when you wear no armor
    - 'Tough skin' skill received some changes to when the name changes (duh)
    - 'Sleeping' skill provides a bit less of hp
    - 'Meditation' skill now provides some 'Strength of mind' xp multipliers
    - 'Meditation' skill now provides a small intuition multiplier
    - 'Strength of Mind' skill now requires 120->400 xp for first level, but cost scaling was reduced x1.9->x1.7
    - some location type penalties now scale up to certain level instead of up to skill max level; scaling information was removed from skill descriptions
    - fieldwork in Village / Town Farms is now unavailable during winters
    - removed defense on wool items
    - for multi-target attacks, xp gains are now divided by target count to provide similar xp gains as with single-target attacks
    - for fighting against a group, xp gains for skills that gain xp when enemy attacks are now divided by target count ^ (2/3) (fighting 8 enemies will only give 2x xp of one)
    - for multi-target attacks, loot drop chances are now divided by target count ^ (2/3) (killing 8 enemies with 1 attack should only give 2x loot instead of 8x)
    - recipes requiring enemy drops are now slightly cheaper to make
    - xp gains for skills are now capped based on what's required for a level up, at 1/10th for general skills and at 1/4th for crafting skill; this generally won't have much impact on gameplay and will only affect some rare cases of extreme gains connected with very low skill level
    - hp bar, stamina bar, and xp bar, now have basic tooltips with breakdows (max health, max stamina and stamina efficiency, global/hero/all_skill xp multiplier)
    - updated 'Sleeping' skill's tooltip so that it mentions the increase to sleeping health restoration (mechanic already existed, but was missing from tooltip)
    - message log will now only scroll down for messages that belong to displayed categories, stuff that is hidden will not cause a scrolling to happen
    - added very simple click effects to some buttons
    - added color change on hover to some elements
    - work payments have been increased
    - trader profit margins were increased
    - increased trade price recovery per day (it's still very low and shouldn't be relied on)
    - reduced 'Wall Rat' agility from 20 to 2 (where are they gonna go? they are stuck in place)
    - increased duration of both types of 'Healing Powder'
    - slightly buffed xp gains for gathering tier 3 wood/metal
    - in dialogues, name of the one being talked to is now displayed above the answers

    - updated enemy lineup creation code to allow using predefined groups in their order (instead of choosing one randomly),
    and to allow using a predefined group every N clears while remaining fights use random enemies
    - jobs can now be made available only in selected seasons; overall time-based limitation was extended to cover training actions as well
    - made it possible for activities to apply active effects
    - made it possible for active effects to affect xp gains
    - changed color of checkboxes to blue, instead of using browser's default colors
    - slightly changed display style of crafting category buttons to hopefully make it a little bit less messy
    - removed some unused location types related to temperatures as those were implemented as a part of weather instead
    
    - fixed component/equipment crafting xp formulas, they now work as described on help page, with scaling starting at 8*tier delayed by sqrt of rarity multiplier (earlier it scaled at every point)
    - fixed a mistake in enemy lineup creation code that resulted in enemy group size capping at 1 less than intended
    - fixed an issue with incorrect display of some of game settings after reloading
    - fixed a minor bug where book bonuses needed save+reload to be properly applied
    - fixed an error on beating a challenge zone that was in favourites
    - fixed a minor multi-crafting bug where if the result was not an integer, the chance for the fraction to be turned into 1 additional item was calculated incorrectly
    - fixed a minor display bug where traded items always ended up at the bottom of respective container, even moving the entire stack down if they were already present there

courtesy of OnonokiNonon:
    - glassmaking module, including 1 new book, 1 new activity, 3 new items and 3 new recipes
    - added 2 new crafting skills: <span class="spoiler"> 'Butchering' and 'Woodworking', with the former also affecting some drop rates; moved relevant recipes from 'Crafting'; 'Butchering and you' now unlocks the skill instead of recipes </span>
    - skill categories can now be reordered
    - a new dialogue that unlocks 2 more food items with their recipes, and a gathering activity for one of their ingredients
    - tweaks to recipe listing code, to make future categories easier to add (a bit of WIP)
    - the recipe window now remembers the last open tab
    - fixed display issues with inventory and fast travel on Firefox
    - maxed out skills are now displayed with a darker shade of green
    - skill categories now persist their open/closed state
    - skills can now be sorted by progress (how close they are to next level, with maxed out skills always displayed last)
    - inventory can now by sorted by type: components/materials of the same type are grouped together, equipment is sorted by slot, etc.
    - harvesting actions can now have their own ambience (BGM) messages
    - actions that give experience now show time to level up in realtime hours
    - larger xp numbers now display with separators and switch to scientific notation at a much higher threshold
    - added a new category to the journal, listing all the books Hero has read and their effects

<button type="button" class="collapsible">v0.4.6 - Actions (and some other things too) [testing release: 01/04/2025 / main release: 18/05/2025] </button>
<div class="content"><pre>
v0.4.6
    - implemented new feature, location actions. Unlike trainings, they are generally a one-time thing that provides unlocks and other rewards.
        They can take different time to complete; have different conditions that are not fully specified but will be hinted at by descriptions; 
        might check if conditions are met either before or after the attempt and may either be guaranteed to succeed if so or just have a chance for it,
        with the latter case having different messages for when you failed due to not meeting requirements vs when you were just unlucky and could succeed next time
    
    - made it possible to craft multiple items/components/equips at once (x5/x10/all)
    - added a mechanic of bonus skill levels (e.g. from better tools); these only apply to the basic effects and do not affect milestones
    - implemented personal storage, available at any place with bed, with shared content
    - added fast travel button, allowing quick moving between locations with unlocked beds and/or last combat location (move here from the normal travel category)

    - added multiple new locations and combat areas: <span class="spoiler">
    * bandit hideout in slums
    * two locations (one normal, one combat) after opening the 'mysterious gate' (The Rat Saga continues)
    * multiple mountain locations (one boss, one combat, a few normal + a camp) after climbing up (unlocked by beating one of cave locations)</span>
    - added better tools for gathering materials
    - added a new crafting material, coal, which is now used in all smelting recipes
        It's own recipe is named "charcoal", don't be confused
        It is crafted with any "raw" wood, using cheapest first. 
        Multicrafting will only use one material type on each click, to avoid accidentally burning higher tiers (ha, got it?)
    - added new metal of tier 3, steel, which requires iron + a new ore to craft; added corresponding weapon components; steel unlocked by:<span class="spoiler">
        Reaching level 15 in Forging skill; needed ore unlocked by beating 'mysterious gate'</span>
    - added ash wood and ash wood components, added weak monster bone components; both are tier 3
    - new activity: climbing
    - new skills: Climbing, Breathing, Medicine. Breathing gains xp passively at a low rate (which increases x5 when in any training)
    - two new books, both unlock "new" recipes (lots of them already existed and simply got locked behind this) + one of them unlocks Medicine skill
    - slightly buffed 'weak healing powder' and 'weak healing potion', added stronger versions of both
    - added some other new ingredients and consumables
    - added miscellaneous items 'coil of rope' and 'camping supplies', each is currently only used for a singular action
    - new spot for meditation + another milestone for the skill
    - skills for gathering materials now belong to a separate skill category (instead of 'Activity skills')
    - 'high quality wolf fang' and 'high quality boar tusk' can now be crafted from 50 normal versions each
    - location navigation now uses similar structure as skill display, that is they are grouped together and expand on click
    - made it possible for xp multipliers to affect entire skill categories (e.g. all 'Activity' skills)
    - item rarity rank is now directly displayed in tooltip (before that you had to guess from the color/quality)
    - tooltips for relevant crafting skills now show quality caps
    - activities (job, training, resource gathering) now display the time needed to level up their related skill 
        (with in-game time format, e.g. 24 hours mean 24 irl minutes at standard tickrate)
    - slightly expanded some skill milestones
    - added a Ko-fi icon with link to my page on the right side of the bottom bar

    - equipment qualities are now rounded to nearest even value to reduce inventory cluttering (similarly to how components already had it rounded to nearest multiple of 4) 
    - made attack speed penalties from shields harsher; they are now also present on light shields (but much weaker than on heavy shields)
    - reduced value of crafting components to ~80%, but increased full equipment prices to ~125% (components are cheaper, but equipment prices stay mostly the same)
    - crafting recipes now show their xp values in tooltips
    - reduced the crafting quality cap to 100 + 2.8 * skill_lvl for equips and 100 + 2 * skill_lvl for components
    - buffed success rates of first 2 woodcutting and mining spots

    - slightly nerfed 'starving wolf rats' and 'wolf rats'
    - slightly nerfed 'starving wolfs' and 'wolves'
    - reduced hero level xp cost scaling from 1.8 to 1.7 (this is a buff)
    - location with boars is now not unlocked directly through dialogue, it instead unlocks an action in the "forest road" to search for the area with them
        If you already went through that dialogue, you will just keep the area unlocked and the action should never appear
    - increased reward for dealing with boars to 4 S

    - slightly rewrote the code for location type penalties, allowing for flat effects (e.g. static hp loss every tick)
    - rewrote combat location N-th clear rewards to a form that allows any reward to have such restriction instead of just location unlocks
    - implemented partial reputation system, doesn't really do anything yet and is not currently displayed anywhere (will be expanded in future)
    - slightly changed display settings of the bottom bar

    - fixed a bug where some activities were stopped on reload with a warning in console, due to mismatch in keys
    - fixed a bug in crafting, where some equipments would end up with a different component than was chosen
    - fixed a bug with market saturation not working properly (item sold count wasn't being updated, leading to situation where item price reduction only applied in bulk trading)
    - fixed a bug where additional stats on componentless equipment (clothing) didn't scale with rarity
    - fixed a bug in crafting equipment, where component quality was ignored in tooltips
    - fixed a bug where if skill changed name on levelup, the level increase message would use the new one

    - fixed a bug with display of unlocked skill milestones, where descriptions sometimes included ", ,"

    - reduced minimum dmg getting through armor from 10% to 5%
v0.4.6.13
    - slightly changed hit/dodge formula to allow an actual 0% chance of being hit; due to this, changed modifiers from enemy group count and enemy size (via skill) to be applied to AP/EP instead (since multiplying 0 by them would be meaningless), which might change how much impact they have

    - fixed a serious error on loading if trying to award some past missed location unlocks
v0.4.6.19

v0.4.6.28
    - added an auto-use option for consumables; it only triggers in combat and is "forgotten" once item runs out
    - replaced "atk pwr" with "atk" in hero combat tab to free some space, changed rounding a bit (values greater/equal to 100 are now rounded to integer)
    - fixed a bug where meditation was still occasionally displayed as '?????' in some tooltips despite being unlocked
v0.4.6.29
    - fixed a bug where some displayed components in equipment tab of crafting stayed visible after switching to another recipe
v0.4.6.30

v0.4.6.31
    - fixed absurdly high sleeping xp gain in mountain camp
v0.4.6.32

======= released to main

    - fixed a bug where newly unlocked beds were not automatically added to fast travel and required save+reload to appear there
    - fixed a bug where for older saves 'Shack' was initially not in the fast travel list and required save+reload to appear there
    - fixed skill names not updating properly in some situations
    - breathing xp is now also gained in all combat locations, at the same rate as outside of training ('thin air'-type locations still gain xp to it from location type on top of that)
    - reduced rat tails required to produce rat meat from 8 to 3
    - 'medicine for dummies' now provides x1.2 Medicine skill xp gain instead of a small flat bonus
