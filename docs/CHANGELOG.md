# Changelog

Development history of this fork, with the reasoning behind each change. Work
arrives here once the matching proposal in [PROPOSALS.md](PROPOSALS.md) reaches
`done`.

Turkish counterpart: [CHANGELOG.TR.md](CHANGELOG.TR.md).

> **Not the in-game changelog.** `changelog.html` at the repository root is the

### Removed references to the upstream deployment — P-6

The fork was still pulling assets from, and pointing users at, the upstream
project. Everything that is infrastructure now resolves against this repository;
everything that is credit stays, and says what it is.

**Deployment identity moved into configuration.** `src/config.js` gained a
`release_ids` block, and `is_on_dev()` / `is_on_main()` in `src/main.js` now
compare against it instead of two hardcoded upstream URLs.

This needed care rather than a find-and-replace. `is_on_dev()` is used in
thirteen places, and one of them chooses which `localStorage` key holds the save
file. On this deployment it currently evaluates to `false`, so live players are
on the production save key — and making it `true` would have silently handed
every existing player an empty save slot. The fix therefore keeps `dev` pointing
at a separate, not-yet-existing deployment path and only corrects `main`, which
is used in exactly one place.

Detection also changed shape. The old comparison was against a full `href`
including protocol and trailing slash, so visiting the site with a query string
or without the trailing slash failed to match its own release. It now compares
normalised `host + pathname`, so `/yairp`, `/yairp/` and `/yairp/?debug` all
resolve to the same release.

**Visitor counter fixed.** It is derived from `release_ids` rather than a
hardcoded upstream URL. Because neither hardcoded URL matched this deployment,
the counter was previously falling through to the placeholder branch on the live
site. Deployments that are neither `main` nor `dev` — a local server, a preview
build — still get an untracked placeholder so they cannot inflate real counts.

**Assets are local.** The favicon and the Open Graph / structured-data preview
image were being fetched from the upstream Pages site even though both files
exist in this repository. They now resolve locally, and `og:url` plus a
structured-data `url` were added, which were missing entirely.

**Repository links point here.** The in-game repository link, and the
contributing and "supporting the game" sections of `help.html`, now point at this
repository.

**Attribution deliberately retained.** The MIT licence requires keeping the
original copyright notice, and the original author explicitly asked that forks
credit and link the original. So `LICENSE` is untouched, the loading screen still
credits Miktaew and now names the continuation underneath, and the descriptions
say the game was created by Miktaew and continued in this fork. The Ko-fi link
belongs to the original author and was relabelled to say so instead of implying
it supports this fork — previously the tooltip read "Support me on Ko-fi!" on a
page that is no longer theirs.

### Repository hygiene: line endings and binaries — P-2

`.gitattributes` did not exist, so end-of-line behaviour depended on each
contributor's local `core.autocrlf` and produced CRLF warnings on every commit.

The fix had a trap in it. A first measurement with `git show :file` suggested
every blob in the repository was stored with CRLF, which would have made
`* text=auto` renormalise every tracked file — an enormous diff, and one that
would conflict with every upstream patch while the sync question is still open.
That measurement was wrong: `git show` applies the working-tree conversion.
`git ls-files --eol` gave the real picture — 50 files at `i/lf w/crlf`, meaning
the index already stores LF and only Windows checkouts are CRLF, which is the
healthy arrangement.

So `* text=auto` merely writes down what the repository already does. It was
verified to produce zero renormalisation before committing: staging everything
touched only the nine intended files. Binaries are marked explicitly, the
committed bundle and the lockfile are marked `-diff linguist-generated` so 730 KB
of minified output stays out of diffs and language statistics, and vendored
HackTimer code is marked `linguist-vendored`.

`.gitignore` gained the `_site/` build output plus log, editor and OS entries.
`package.json` and `package-lock.json` were previously **ignored** and are now
tracked. The upstream `.eslintrc.json` and `.dependency-cruiser.js` entries were
kept but annotated: they are local-only configs, and anyone adding a shared
linter config has to remove the line first, or the config will silently refuse to
be committed.

### GitHub Pages deploy pipeline — P-2

A supplied example workflow was checked against the actual repository. Six of its
eight assumptions did not hold:

| Problem | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Triggered on `main`; the default branch is `master`, so it would never have run | trigger on `master` |
| `npm ci` with no `package.json` — which `.gitignore` was actively excluding | `package.json` added and un-ignored |
| `cache: npm` with no lockfile, which fails the setup step | lockfile committed, caching enabled |
| `npm run build`, `check` and `test:browser` — none of these scripts existed | `build` and `check` written; `test:browser` dropped |
| `scripts/build-site.js` referenced in a comment but absent | written |
| Artifact path `dist`, which holds only the bundle while `index.html` is at the root — this would have deployed a site with no pages | artifact path `_site` |

Action versions in the example were checked against the registry rather than
assumed: `checkout@v7`, `configure-pages@v6`, `upload-pages-artifact@v5` and
`deploy-pages@v5` were all current and were left alone. Only `setup-node` was a
major version behind and was raised to `v7`.

`test:browser` was dropped rather than faked. There is no test infrastructure,
and the in-repo `Verify_Game_Objects()` is a browser runtime global that needs a
DOM, so running it means adding a headless browser dependency — a separate
decision, not something to smuggle into a deploy fix.

The CI node version is pinned to 24 on purpose. That is the active LTS; Node 26
is current but not yet LTS. `engines.node` is `>=22`, which is the floor for
contributors, not the CI target.

Pages turned out not to need manual enablement: `configure-pages` and
`deploy-pages` provisioned the site themselves on the first run.

### Build and validation scripts — P-2, P-3

**`scripts/build-site.js`** bundles `src/main.js` with esbuild and assembles the
deployable site into `_site/`, rewriting the `index.html` copy to load the bundle.

The separation matters. The repository root is the development entry point: its
`index.html` deliberately loads `src/main.js` so the game runs off any static
server with no build step. The existing `build.js` rewrites that tracked file in
place, which dirties the working tree on every CI run. The new builder applies
the rewrite to the `_site/` copy instead, so both modes coexist: edit and reload
with no build locally, minified and version-stamped in production.

This distinction has a direct consequence for translations. esbuild resolves the
dynamic `import()` in `src/translation.js` by globbing `locales/` at build time
and inlining every match into the bundle, so a newly added locale file is
invisible to bundle mode until the next build — while dev mode fetches it at
runtime and needs no rebuild. CI rebuilds on every push, so this only affects
local bundle-mode testing.

Every substitution in the `index.html` rewrite is asserted, so a change to that
file that breaks an assumption fails the build loudly instead of shipping a blank
page. Writing those assertions immediately caught a bug in the rewrite itself: a
`[^>]*` pattern could not reach the closing `-->` of the commented-out script tag
because the tag body contains `>` characters, so the comment survived and the
build would have produced a page with two script tags.

**`scripts/check-site.js`** validates the assembled site and, more importantly,
locale key parity — groundwork for P-7. Unknown keys in a translation and variant
keys with no base key are errors, because both are always bugs; missing
translations are reported as a coverage percentage so CI stays green while a
translation is in progress, with `LOCALE_STRICT=1` to make them fatal. Verified
against a deliberately broken locale rather than assumed to work.

### Toolchain modernised — P-3

- `engines.node` raised to `>=22`.
- esbuild raised to `^0.28.2`. The initial `^0.25.0` pin was itself a bug: caret
  ranges lock the minor on `0.x` versions, so `^0.25.0` resolves at most `0.25.x`
  and could never have reached `0.28`.
- **`live-server` removed entirely.** Its last release was April 2022, and it
  accounted for 195 of 222 installed packages, including several deprecated
  transitive dependencies. Nothing replaced it: esbuild, already a dependency,
  ships a static server, so `npm run serve` uses `--servedir`. Installed packages
  went from 222 to 27.
- `serve:site` added, to preview the built `_site/` output in bundle mode before
  deploying.

MIME types were verified rather than assumed, because a wrong `Content-Type`
silently breaks `<script type="module">`. The esbuild server returns
`text/javascript` for both `src/main.js` and `locales/english.js`.

## Before this fork

The version history of the game itself, up to and including the point this fork
diverged, is in `changelog.html` and in the upstream repository. This file starts
