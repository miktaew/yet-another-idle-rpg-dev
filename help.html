                    <br>"Haggling" skill slightly reduces price difference, at max level the value above 100% is cut in half (meaning 200% will turn into 150%, 300% will turn into 200%, etc)

                    As you sell more of enemy loot, its price will slowly go down, stopping at 1/10th of initial value. It applies to all traders. 
                    <br>The price will recover over time, but it is a very slow process.

                    Their quality doesn't directly translate to equipment stats and so their own statistics are displayed as "base value", as in value that they would contribute to a 100% quality piece of equipment
                </li>
                <li>
                    Equipment: the actual stuff that you can put on. Mostly created from components, with the exception of 'clothing' which functions more like wearable components<br>
                    Quality is based on skill level, quality of components (for non-clothing equipment) and either tier of components (for non-clothing) or tier of resulting clothing item

        <li>You can obtain resources from passive activities in locations and/or as a loot from combat; items that can be used for crafting will often (but not always) mention it in their descriptions<br>
            For passive gathering activities, things such as time needed, success chance and number of gained items are all affected by skill level.

                <li>Shield can absorb damage and has very high base chance to trigger, but usually won't be strong enough to reduce it to 0, although it is possible.</li>
                <li>"Defense" provides a flat reduction to damage taken. It is applied after shield dmg reduction.<br>
                    It can't reduce damage taken to less than 1 or 10% of original value, whichever is larger. However, if less than that gets through the shield, that value will be used instead, allowing for very small dmg values and/or full negation.</li>

            Attack speed:

                <li>
                    Directly translates to how quickly someone attacks in comparison to another fight participant. 2x more => 2x faster. 2x less => 2x slower.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To avoid insanity and potential problems, when new fight begins, both character and enemies have their attack cooldowns scaled up so that no one attacks faster than once per second.

                <li>It can also be delayed by raising the max stamina and/or using food items, which provide stamina regeneration in combat</li>

                    Provide different buffs and penalties, being helpful in different situations, in exchange for higher stamina costs.

                <li>
                    Switching stance mid-combat will reset your attack bar (no cheesing allowed).

            During night (20 to 4) in normal areas, and whole time in dark areas (e.g. caves), character receives additional penalties to hit/evasion chance.
            <br>
            This penalty can be reduced with "Night  vision" skill, which gains xp passively just for being in such place.

            Some combat areas have special properties, which result in penalties to certain stats. E.g. some areas might not offer enough movement space to properly dodge or make a good swing with weapon
